# Ancient Mysteries

This repository contains research on ancient mysteries.

Main website is here: [TrueRealityNow.com - Ancient Mysteries and Consciousness Technologies](https://truerealitynow.com)

Our current project is to explain the hypotesis that an ancient civilization existed 12,800 years ago, and became extinct by the Younger Dryas Impact Event.

Here we publish open source aspects of the project, links, ebook code etc.

The team members are Mikael Kindborg and GÃ¶sta Lindwall. We have a background in research, computer programming, and visual communication.
